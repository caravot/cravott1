* It must allow **multiple user options**. That is, the user should not be restricted to a specific sequence of actions. They should be able to choose the action they will take next (find information, choose a product, view the cart, etc.).
* It must involve **session** data related to users (such as a shopping cart, list of courses, etc.).
* It must have a good **user interface**. I don't expect anything too elaborate (although really nice features might result in extra credit), but the pages generated by the system should be readable and uniform.
* It must require **input validation**. Any errors should be trapped by the system and presented to the user as informative error messages (instead of Tomcat exception pages).
* You don't have to use a database to store the data but must session and Java Beans to store data (Database usage is encouraged though).
* At least one or two pages must implement **SSL**.
